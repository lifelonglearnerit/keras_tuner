Exploration of different applications of Keras Tuner 

KerasTuner is an easy-to-use, scalable hyperparameter optimization framework that solves the pain points of hyperparameter search. Easily configure your search space with a define-by-run syntax, then leverage one of the available search algorithms to find the best hyperparameter values for your models. KerasTuner comes with Bayesian Optimization, Hyperband, and Random Search algorithms built-in.

I used KerasTuner with great success in different projects this repository contains the examples of many different applications of kt. KerasTuner is strongly integrated into Keras workflows but it isn't limited to them and I used it also for tuning hyperparameters in Sklearn models. Code in this repository was created from 01.2022 to 07.2022
